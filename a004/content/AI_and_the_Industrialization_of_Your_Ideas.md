Customer privacy is sacred. This is why it’s always announced loudly, repeatedly, and with great confidence, usually right before you’re encouraged to paste your entire codebase into an AI prompt, “just to refactor a small thing.”

Don’t worry though. Your code isn’t stored, they say. It’s just processed. Abstracted. Learned from. Reused. Which, conveniently, is everything that matters. The specifics don’t need to be copied when the idea is preserved, optimized, and redistributed at scale. Congratulations: your proprietary system has been converted into a feature of someone else’s platform.

AI doesn’t steal your code. It makes it unproprietary. Your architecture is flattened into patterns. Your clever solution becomes a recommendation. Your business logic turns into “industry standard.” Big tech doesn’t need to read your prompts. They own the models, the training pipelines, and the datacenters where your ideas go to be industrialized.

And when competitors suddenly ship systems that resemble yours, with the same boundaries, the same trade-offs, and the same “lessons learned,” that’s not coincidence. That’s gravity. Ideas flow uphill, toward whoever owns the compute.
